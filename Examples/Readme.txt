The example demos  for using LZScene of GLXEngine with Lazarus

For all this ../Examples/Demoz  it supposed that  
- demos projects are in ..\Examples\Demoz directory;
- media files are in ..\Examples\media,
and they need to move in Assets further; 

Additional Dynamic libraries, common DLLs are in ..\external directory, 
that should be renamed to Externals as in GLXEngine;
